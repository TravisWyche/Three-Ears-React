          Nestled a short drive outside of Taos, New Mexico, TEARS finds its
          home in the embrace of the Carson National Forest, at the base of the
          titular Tres Orejas peaks, in the southern part of the Sangre de
          Cristo mountain range. The area&apos;s high-altitude temperate desert
          climate offers dry cold winters and gentle warm summers, creating an
          idyllic setting for individual and small group creative practices. Our
          1,000-square-foot Earthship captures water from the sky, generates
          electricity from the sun, and is a marvel of sustainable living amidst
          the sagebrush ocean of the Carson National Forest with profound
          opportunity to experience the range of the landâ€™s cycles, in a space
          built with regard and respect for them.

            Over the past four years, steward TW has devoted himself to
            rehabilitating the land and dwelling within the ship, engaging in
            ecological, architectural, conceptual, and aesthetic explorations.
            This Earthship is not only a hub for technological and design
            practices but also a cozy habitat offering ample space for artists,
            musicians, writers, builders, and think-feelers to thrive. Our

            , aiming to foster a regenerative, imaginative, and convivial
            culture. We aspire to construct a social, cultural, and economic
            architecture that prioritizes artistic inquiry and reciprocal value
            exchange over utilitarian economic extraction, inviting our first
            residents to immerse themselves in this ethos and contribute to a
            culture of open, porous, improvisational, and diaphanous exchange
            for all who follow.

          TW&apos;s engagement with web3 economics and governance structures
          through associations with Moloch DAO, Gitcoin, DAOhaus, RaidGuild, and
          MetaCartel, among others, underscores our venture into community
          stewardship and progressively decentralized governance. We envision a
          synergy between the bleeding-edge web3 domain and the creative
          insights of artists, aiming to foster a refreshed pluriversal
          perspective through this experimental residency. This endeavor is an
          empirical exploration to enhance and refine our collective
          understanding, benefiting the residents, local human and non-human
          neighbors, and acknowledging the rich historical and cultural fabric
          of our site. We welcome risk-takers and innovators committed to slow,
          reparative actions that avoid perpetuating epistemic violences, aiming
          to cultivate a sustainable and fertile microclimate for our inaugural
          cohort to dream boldly together.
